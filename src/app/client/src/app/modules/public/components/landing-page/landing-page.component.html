                    <!-- <p>In 2000, ten years later, the international community met again at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal,
                        an event which drew 1100 participants.</p> -->
                    <p>
                        The Honâ€™ble Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Shri Yogi Adityanath, has envisioned the ambitious goal of turning UP into a hub of quality nursing and paramedical education in the state.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>The forum took stock of the fact that many countries were far from having reached the goals established at the
                        World Conference on Education for All in 1990.</p> -->
                    <p>
                        In order to realize this vision, Mission Niramaya was formulated by UP State Medical Faculty, under the aegis of the Department of Medical Education, and was subsequently launched by the CM on 8th October 2022. A bouquet of reforms are envisioned under this Mission, which are going to be enabled through a population scale technological platform.

                    <!-- <p>The participants agreed on the Dakar Framework for Action which re-affirmed their commitment to achieving Education
                        for All by the year 2015, and identified six key measurable education goals which aim to meet the learning
                        needs of all children, youth and adults by 2015.</p> -->
                    <p>
                        The aim of this platform is to bring most of its student and institute management processes online, and to turn SMF into a competency-focussed regulator of human resources in health.
